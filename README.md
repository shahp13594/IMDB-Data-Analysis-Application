# IMDB-Data-Analysis-Application
Developed an data analysis application which runs queries on the imdb data and extracts useful information.  Used Oracle 11g database for populating the imdb data into it and SQL for querying the data.  The primary users for this application will be users seeking for movies and their ratings that match their search criteria.  Built a user interface for the application using Java Swings that provides the user the available movie attributes such as genre of the movie, country in which it was shoot, cast of the movies, rating of the movie, year in which the movie was released and user’s reviews and ratings.  Using this application, the user can search for the movies from various categories that have the properties or attributes the user is looking for.  The user can filter the search results by available movie attributes such as genre, country, cast, rating, year and user’s tags and ratings. Dataset included approximately 2113 users, 10197 movies, 855598 ratings and 13222 tags.  Implemented database concepts like normalization for removing redundancy and indexing for faster information retrieval and faster query performance.
